            <h4>What are enchantments?</h4>
            <p>Islands are the land types which produce blue mana. Blue mana is often associated with intellect and logic along with artifice/technology and the mind. Some of the most commmon creatures you will find that are of the color blue are wizards and vedalken(this is a species that specifically exists only in the MTG universe) and often times these creatures get their power from the mind and various technology that exists in the MTG universe.</p>
            <h4>What do creatures do?</h4>
            <p>Cards that are blue/require mana from islands often involve some sort of control or card drawing effect. Blue cards are known for the aspect of control that they allow players to have over the game. This can range anywhere from preventing you from being able to play cards to controlling where your permanents go when they are removed from the board. Another thing that blue specializes in is card draw and seeing into the future through a mechanic known as scrying. Scrying lets you look at cards from the top of your library and you can chose whether you want to draw those cards or put them at the bottom of your deck. Drawing cards is also something blue does very well and some of the best cards that let you draw more cards are in blue. Blue is known for letting you get ahead in the game but the downside to blue is the creatures are often weak as a result of being focused on casting spells and providing you seer-like abilities.</p>
