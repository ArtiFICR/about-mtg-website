            <h4>What are plains?</h4>
            <p>Plains are the land types which produce white mana. White mana is often associated with law and order as well as peace and stability. Some of the most common creatures you will find that are of the color white are angels and soldiers and often times these creatures are tied to some divine power which allows them to become more powerful.</p>
            <h4>What do white cards do?</h4>
            <p>Cards that are white/require mana from plains often involve some sort of life gain or exile effect. White cards are known for removing things from the battlefield and ensuring that they stay gone through what is known as boardwipes. Boardwipes effectively remove a mass amount of permanents from the board, often times being creatures that are removed. While white is known for its removal effects white is also known for protecting you and your own stuff through what is known as blinking and silencing/taxing effects. Blinking is what happens when you remove a permanent from the board and it immediately comes back, effectively mimicking a blink effect. Silencing effects often prevent your opponents from doing certain things and prevents them from making stuff happen, effectively "silencing" them in the game. Taxing effects typically require you to spend more mana to do things so you end up having to wait longer to do what you want to do when playing a game of MTG.</p>
