            <h4>What are wastes?</h4>
            <p>Wastes are the land types which produce colorless mana. Colorless mana can be paid for using any color but costs that have the above icon in them can not be paid for using colored mana and you have to use colorless mana to pay for wastes. Some of the most common creatures that are colorless are often artifact creatures such as myr and thopters which use artifice to make themselves more powerful or a species known as eldrazi(think cthulu) which are known for distorting reality into the void.</p>
            <h4>What do colorless cards do?</h4>
            <p>Cards that are colorless/require mana from wastes typically use aspects from all colors. Due to colorless being composed of mostly artifacts and technology, it is able to do anything any other color can do, but it can not do those abilities as well as the colors they were designed for can. One specialty about colorless though is the fact that it is known for exiling not just your opponents stuff from their board, but also cards from your opponents hand along with cards in their deck. Another popular mechanic seen in colorless are artifacts, which is the main reason colorless can do anything that any of the 5 colors can. There is no limit to what you can do with colorless and colorless gives you the most flexibility.</p>
