            <h4>What are swamps?</h4>
            <p>Swamps are the land types which produce black mana. Black mana is often associated with death and decay along with power and self-interests. Some of the most common creatures you will find that are of the color black are vampires and zombies which get their power from death itself and many beings associated with black use this black mana to gain power for their own self-interests in whatever way possible, regardless of the consequences.</p>
            <h4>What do black cards do?</h4>
            <p>Cards that are black/require mana from swamps often involve some sort of destroy or resource denial effect. Black cards are known for their aspect of spot removal, or removing specific pieces from the board of your choosing, and resource denial which usually involves forcing your opponents to discard their cards in their hand to their graveyard which usually results in that player not being able to play that card. The graveyard is one thing that is very important when it comes to black mana as black mana is also known for its reanimation effects, or bringing stuff that has been killed/sent to the graveyard back onto your battlefield, effectively bringing your creatures back to life. Necromancer effects are usually only seen in black along with spot removal effects and while other colors have access to spot removal(see white with exile effects), black has the best forms of spot removal out of all of the colors in MTG.</p>
