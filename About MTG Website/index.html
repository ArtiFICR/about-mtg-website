            <h3>What is MTG?</h3>
            <p>MTG, or Magic: the Gathering, is a collectable trading card game that was created back in 1993 by a person known as Richard Garfield. It requires at minimum 2 players to play and there is no limit to how many players can be in just 1 game. The game is set in what is known as the multiverse. The creatures and living beings that live in the multiverse reside on what are known as planes, which is the equivalent of a planet in our universe.</p>

            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>In the game of MTG there is what is known as a mana system which is what allows you to play your cards. The mana system works by using what is known as lands that can produce mana. When mana is produced it can then be used to play your cards from your hand. There are 6 different types of mana that can be used and each mana type has something unique that it does better than all of the other mana types.</p>
