            <h4>What are creatures?</h4>
            <p>Creatures are cards in MTG that are known as permanents, which means that once you cast them they stay on the board permanently until they are removed in some form. They have what is known as a power and toughness which determines how much damage they can deal and how much damage they can take before they die.</p>
            <h4>What do creatures do?</h4>
            <p>Creature cards are used mainly for attacking and defending yourself. By attacking with creatures you can lower your opponents life total which can kill your opponent if they are not careful. Creatures typically have what is known as summoning sickness, which means that the turn you play your creatures you are not allowed to attack with them. Creatures also typically have what is known as keywords on them that give them additional abilities such as haste(this keyword allows your creatures to attack the turn you play them) or some ability that enhances them. How they get enchanced and what abilities they have depend on the color that the creatures are. Another thing to note about creatures is when you attack with them you do what is known as tapping them, or turning them sideways to signify you have attacked with those creatures. Creatures do not become untapped until your next turn and while creatures are tapped they can not block opponents creatures.</p>
