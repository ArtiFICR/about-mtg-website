            <h4>What are mountains?</h4>
            <p>Mountains are the land types which produce red mana. Red mana is often associated with the liberation and chaos along with fire and making your creatures quicker/more energized. Some of the most common creatures you will find that are of the color red are dragons and goblins which get their power from fire and the earth along with rage and aggression and beings who are red are known for their destructive capabilities.</p>
            <h4>What do red cards do?</h4>
            <p>Cards that are red/require mana from mountains often involve some sort of burn or randomness effect. Red cards are known for their aspect of burning things, or damaging either your opponents or their creatures directly, and randomness, or having an effect happen at random such as discarding a card at random which usually results in an advantage for the person playing red because these random effects often have more bang for their buck and the direct damage ability allows you to completely avoid having to deal with your opponents creatures. Another aspect of red is making your creatures hasty and faster by allowing them to attack sooner than your opponents creatures can which puts them at a disadvantage and forces your opponents to have to think on the defensive side, allowing you to have a better chance at success.</p>
