            <h4>What are Forests?</h4>
            <p>Forests are the land types which produce green mana. Green mana is often associated with the natural world and life as well as strength and survival of the fittest. Some of the most common creatures you will find in green are elves and beasts which often get their power from the nature and the natural world. Beings who are green are known for being strong and in tune with nature and are known to grow stronger and stronger.</p>
            <h4>What do green cards do?</h4>
            <p>Cards that are green/require mana from forests often involve some sort of growing effect which makes your creatures stronger or artifact and enchantment destruction. Green cards are known for the aspect of producing mana and making creatures bigger and better. Green is the best color when it comes to a concept known as mana ramping, or increasing your mana count significantly in short amount of time, along with mana dorks, or creatures who produce mana themselves. Land production effects are primarily seen in green and while other colors can do this, green does this the best. Another upside to playing green is green is very useful when it comes to removing pesky artifacts and enchantments so the cards your opponents often use to give themselves an advantage can be dealt with by using green.</p>
