            <h4>What are artifacts?</h4>
            <p>Artifacts are cards in MTG that are known as permanents. They are usually colorless but can be a color of some sort. Artifacts are known for being able to do anything any other color can do but it does not do things as well as the colors that are designed for whatever ability the artifact is doing.</p>
            <h4>What do artifacts do?</h4>
            <p>Artifacts are mainly used as a way to make up for the lack of certain colors in your deck in order to help your deck perform better. One mechanic that is only seen in artifacts is equipping. This is due to artifacts are the only card type that can be something like a sword or shield that a creature can use. Artifacts are also really good at making it to where you can produce mana if you are falling behind everyone else in terms of your resources. There are many things artifacts can do and the possibilities of what they are capable of is endless.</p>
